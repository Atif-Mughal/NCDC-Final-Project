<h2 align="left">🚀 Getting Started</h2>

### Prerequisites

- **SystemVerilog simulator** (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, Mentor QuestaSim).
- **UVM library** (Unified Verification Methodology).

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/axi4-vip.git
   cd axi4-vip
   ```

2. Compile and run with your simulator:
   ```bash
   vcs -full64 -sverilog -ntb_opts uvm src/*.sv tests/*.sv -o simv
   ./simv
   ```

3. Analyze the results in the log file or waveform viewer.
