<h2 align="left">🚀 Getting Started</h2>

### Prerequisites

- **SystemVerilog simulator**: Cadence Xcelium (Recommended)
- **UVM library**: Unified Verification Methodology

### Running the Simulation with Cadence Xcelium

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atif-Mughal/NCDC-Final-Project.git
   cd NCDC-Final-Project
   ```

2. Navigate to the top-level directory where the simulation run file (`run.f`) is located.

3. Run the simulation using the `xrun` command:
   ```bash
   xrun -f run.f
   ```

4. Analyze the results:
   - Use the Xcelium log files to debug and verify test outcomes.
   - View waveforms using any compatible waveform viewer (e.g., SimVision).
